This post is the third in the series on the C++ Coroutines TS ([N4736](http://wg21.link/N4736)).

The previous articles in this series cover:
* [Coroutine Theory]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-09-25-coroutine-theory.md %})
* [Understanding operator co_await]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-11-17-understanding-operator-co-await.md %})

In this post I look at the mechanics of how the compiler translates coroutine code that
you write into compiled code and how you can customise the behaviour of a coroutine by
defining your own **Promise** type.

## Coroutine Concepts

The Coroutines TS adds three new keywords: `co_await`, `co_yield` and `co_return`. Whenever you use one
of these coroutine keywords in the body of a function this triggers the compiler to compile this function
as a coroutine rather than as a normal function.

The compiler applies some fairly mechanical transformations to the code that you write to turn it into
a state-machine that allows it to suspend execution at particular points within the function and then
later resume execution.

In the previous post I described the first of two new interfaces that the Coroutines TS introduces:
The **Awaitable** interface. The second interface that the TS introduces that is important to this
code transformation is the **Promise** interface.

The **Promise** interface specifies methods for customising the behaviour of the coroutine itself.
The library-writer is able to customise what happens when the coroutine is called, what
happens when the coroutine returns (either by normal means or via an unhandled exception)
and customise the behaviour of any `co_await` or `co_yield` expression within the coroutine.

## Promise objects

The **Promise** object defines and controls the behaviour of the coroutine itself
by implementing methods that are called at specific points during execution of the
coroutine.

An instance of the promise object is constructed within the coroutine frame for
each invocation of a coroutine function.

The compiler generates calls to certain methods on the promise object at key points
during execution of the coroutine.

In the following examples, assume that the promise object created in the coroutine
frame for a particular invocation of the coroutine is `promise`.

When you write a coroutine function that has a body, `<body-statements>`, which
contains one of the coroutine keywords (`co_return`, `co_await`, `co_yield`) then
the body of the coroutine is transformed to something (roughly) like the following:

```c++
{
  co_await promise.initial_suspend();
  try
  {
    <body-statements>
  }
  catch (...)
  {
    promise.unhandled_exception();
  }
FinalSuspend:
  co_await promise.final_suspend();
}
```

When a coroutine function is called there are a number of steps that are
performed prior to executing the code in the source of the coroutine body that
are a little different to regular functions.

Here is a summary of the steps (I'll go into more detail on each of the steps below).

1. Allocate a coroutine frame using `operator new` (optional).
2. Copy any function parameters to the coroutine frame.
3. Call the constructor for the promise object of type, `P`.
4. Call the `promise.get_return_object()` method to obtain the result to return to the caller
   when the coroutine first suspends. Save the result as a local variable.
5. Call the `promise.initial_suspend()` method and `co_await` the result.
6. When the `co_await promise.initial_suspend()` expression resumes (either immediately
   or asynchronously), then the coroutine starts executing the coroutine body statements that you wrote.

Some additional steps are executed when execution reaches a `co_return` statement:
1. Call `promise.return_void()` or `promise.return_value(<expr>)`
2. Destroy all variables with automatic storage duration in reverse order they were created.
3. Call `promise.final_suspend()` and `co_await` the result.

If instead, execution leaves `<body-statements>` due to an unhandled exception then:
1. Catch the exception and call `promise.unhandled_exception()` from within the catch-block.
2. Call `promise.final_suspend()` and `co_await` the result.

Once execution propagates outside of the coroutine body then the coroutine
frame is destroyed. Destroying the coroutine frame involves a number of steps:
1. Call the destructor of the promise object.
2. Call the destructors of the function parameter copies.
3. Call `operator delete` to free the memory used by the coroutine frame (optional)
4. Transfer execution back to the caller/resumer.

When execution first reaches a `<return-to-caller-or-resumer>` point inside a `co_await`
expression, or if the coroutine runs to completion without hitting a `<return-to-caller-or-resumer>`
point, then the coroutine is either suspended or destroyed and the return-object previously
returned from the call to `promise.get_return_object()` is then returned to the caller of the
coroutine.

### Allocating a coroutine frame

First, the compiler generates a call to `operator new` to allocate memory
for the coroutine frame.

If the promise type, `P`, defines a custom `operator new` method then that
is called, otherwise the global `operator new` is called.

There are a few important things to note here:

The size passed to `operator new` is not `sizeof(P)` but is rather the size of the
entire coroutine frame and is determined automatically by the compiler based on the
number and sizes of parameters, size of the promise object, number and sizes of local
variables and other compiler-specific storage needed for management of coroutine state.

The compiler is free to elide the call to `operator new` as an optimisation if:
* it is able to determine that the lifetime of the coroutine frame is strictly nested within
  the lifetime of the caller; and
* the compiler can see the size of coroutine frame required at the call-site.

In these cases, the compiler can allocate storage for the coroutine frame in the caller's
activation frame (either in the stack-frame or coroutine-frame part).

The Coroutines TS does not yet specify any situations in which the allocation elision
is guaranteed, so you still need to write code as if the allocation of the coroutine
frame may fail with `std::bad_alloc`. This also means that you usually shouldn't declare
a coroutine function as `noexcept` unless you are ok with `std::terminate()` being
called if the coroutine fails to allocate memory for the coroutine frame.

There is a fallback, however, that can be used in lieu of exceptions for handling
failure to allocate the coroutine frame. This can be necessary when operating in
environments where exceptions are not allowed, such as embedded environments
or high-performance environments where the overhead of exceptions is not tolerated.

If the promise type provides a static `P::get_return_object_on_allocation_failure()`
member function then the compiler will generate a call to the
`operator new(size_t, nothrow_t)` overload instead. If that call returns `nullptr`
then the coroutine will immediately call `P::get_return_object_on_allocation_failure()`
and return the result to the caller of the coroutine instead of throwing an exception.

#### Customising coroutine frame memory allocation

Your promise type can define an overload of `operator new()` that will be called
instead of global-scope `operator new` if the compiler needs to allocate memory
for a coroutine frame that uses your promise type.

For example:
```c++
struct my_promise_type
{
  void* operator new(std::size_t size)
  {
    void* ptr = my_custom_allocate(size);
    if (!ptr) throw std::bad_alloc{};
    return ptr;
  }

  void operator delete(void* ptr, std::size_t size)
  {
    my_custom_free(ptr, size);
  }

  ...
};
```

"But what about custom allocators?", I hear you asking.

You can also provide an overload of `P::operator new()` that takes additional arguments
which will be called with lvalue references to the coroutine function parameters
if a suitable overload can be found. This can be used to hook up `operator new`
to call an `allocate()` method on an allocator that was passed as an argument to
the coroutine function.

You will need to do some extra work to make a copy of the allocator inside the allocated
memory so you can reference it in the corresponding call to `operator delete` since the
parameters are not passed to the corresponding `operator delete` call. This is because
the parameters are stored in the coroutine-frame and so they will have already been
destructed by the time that `operator delete` is called.

For example, you can implement `operator new` so that it allocates extra space after the
coroutine frame and use that space to stash a copy of the allocator that can be used to
free the coroutine frame memory.

For example:
```c++
template<typename ALLOCATOR>
struct my_promise_type
{
  template<typename... ARGS>
  void* operator new(std::size_t sz, std::allocator_arg_t, ALLOCATOR& allocator, ARGS&... args)
  {
    // Round up sz to next multiple of ALLOCATOR alignment
    std::size_t allocatorOffset =
      (sz + alignof(ALLOCATOR) - 1u) & ~(alignof(ALLOCATOR) - 1u);

    // Call onto allocator to allocate space for coroutine frame.
    void* ptr = allocator.allocate(allocatorOffset + sizeof(ALLOCATOR));

    // Take a copy of the allocator (assuming noexcept copy constructor here)
    new (((char*)ptr) + allocatorOffset) ALLOCATOR(allocator);

    return ptr;
  }

  void operator delete(void* ptr, std::size_t sz)
  {
    std::size_t allocatorOffset =
      (sz + alignof(ALLOCATOR) - 1u) & ~(alignof(ALLOCATOR) - 1u);

    ALLOCATOR& allocator = *reinterpret_cast<ALLOCATOR*>(
      ((char*)ptr) + allocatorOffset);

    // Move allocator to local variable first so it isn't freeing its
    // own memory from underneath itself.
    // Assuming allocator move-constructor is noexcept here.
    ALLOCATOR allocatorCopy = std::move(allocator);

    // But don't forget to destruct allocator object in coroutine frame
    allocator.~ALLOCATOR();

    // Finally, free the memory using the allocator.
    allocatorCopy.deallocate(ptr, allocatorOffset + sizeof(ALLOCATOR));
  }
}
```

To hook up the custom `my_promise_type` to be used for coroutines that
pass `std::allocator_arg` as the first parameter, you need to specialise
the `coroutine_traits` class (see section on `coroutine_traits` below for 
more details).

For example:
```
namespace std::experimental
{
  template<typename ALLOCATOR, typename... ARGS>
  struct coroutine_traits<my_return_type, std::allocator_arg_t, ALLOCATOR, ARGS...>
  {
    using promise_type = my_promise_type<ALLOCATOR>;
  };
}
```

Note that even if you customise the memory allocation strategy for a coroutine,
**the compiler is still allowed to elide the call to your memory allocator**.

### Copying parameters to the coroutine frame

The coroutine needs to copy any parameters passed to the coroutine function by
the original caller into the coroutine frame so that they remain valid after
the coroutine is suspended.

If parameters are passed to the coroutine by value, then those parameters are
copied to the coroutine frame by calling the type's move-constructor.

If parameters are passed to the coroutine by reference (either lvalue or rvalue),
then only the references are copied into the coroutine frame, not the values
they point to.

Note that for types with trivial destructors, the compiler is free to elide the
copy of the parameter if the parameter is never referenced after a reachable
`<return-to-caller-or-resumer>` point in the coroutine.

There are many gotchas involved when passing parameters by reference into coroutines
as you cannot necessarily rely on the reference remaining valid for the lifetime of
the coroutine. Many common techniques used with normal functions, such as
perfect-forwarding and universal-references, can result in code that has undefined
behaviour if used with coroutines. Toby Allsopp has written a
[great article](https://toby-allsopp.github.io/2017/04/22/coroutines-reference-params.html)
on this topic if you want more details.

If any of the parameter copy/move constructors throws an exception then any parameters
already constructed are destructed, the coroutine frame is freed and the exception
propagates back out to the caller.

### Constructing the promise object

Once all of the parameters have been copied into the coroutine frame, the coroutine
then constructs the promise object.

The reason the parameters are copied prior to the promise object being constructed
is to allow the promise object to be given access to the pre-copied parameters
in its constructor.

First, the compiler checks to see if there is an overload of the promise constructor
that can accept lvalue references to each of the copied parameters. If the compiler
finds such an overload then the compiler generates a call to that constructor overload.
If it does not find such an overload then the compiler falls back to generating a call
to the promise type's default constructor.

Note that the ability for the promise constructor to "peek" at the parameters was a
relatively recent change to the Coroutines TS, being adopted in [N4723](http://wg21.link/N4723)
at the Jacksonville 2018 meeting. See [P0914R1](http://wg21.link/P0914R1) for the proposal.
Thus it may not be supported by some older versions of Clang or MSVC.

If the promise constructor throws an exception then the parameter copies are
destructed and the coroutine frame freed during stack unwinding before the
exception propagates out to the caller.

### Obtaining the return object

The first thing a coroutine does with the promise object is obtain the `return-object`
by calling `promise.get_return_object()`.

The `return-object` is the value that is returned to the caller of the coroutine function
when the coroutine first suspends or after it runs to completion and execution returns
to the caller.

You can think of the control flow going something (very roughly) like this:
```c++
// Pretend there's a compiler-generated structure called 'coroutine_frame'
// that holds all of the state needed for the coroutine. Its constructor
// takes a copy of parameters and default-constructs a promise object.
struct coroutine_frame { ... };

T some_coroutine(P param)
{
  auto* f = new coroutine_frame(std::forward<P>(param));

  auto returnObject = f->promise.get_return_object();

  // Start execution of the coroutine body by resuming it.
  // This call will return when the coroutine gets to the first
  // suspend-point or when the coroutine runs to completion.
  coroutine_handle<decltype(f->promise)>::from_promise(f->promise).resume();

  // Then the return object is returned to the caller.
  return returnObject;
}
```

Note that we need to obtain the return-object before starting the coroutine
body since the coroutine frame (and thus the promise object) may be destroyed
prior to the call to `coroutine_handle::resume()` returning, either on this
thread or possibly on another thread, and so it would be unsafe to call
`get_return_object()` after starting execution of the coroutine body.

### The initial-suspend point

The next thing the coroutine executes once the coroutine frame has been
initialised and the return object has been obtained is execute the statement
`co_await promise.initial_suspend();`.

This allows the author of the `promise_type` to control whether the coroutine should
suspend before executing the coroutine body that appears in the source code or start
executing the coroutine body immediately.

If the coroutine suspends at the initial suspend point then it can be later resumed
or destroyed at a time of your choosing by calling `resume()` or `destroy()` on the
coroutine's `coroutine_handle`.

The result of the `co_await promise.initial_suspend()` expression is discarded so
implementations should generally return `void` from the `await_resume()` method
of the awaiter.

It is important to note that this statement exists outside of the `try`/`catch` block
that guards the rest of the coroutine (scroll back up to the definition of the coroutine
body if you've forgotten what it looks like). This means that any exception thrown from the
`co_await promise.initial_suspend()` evaluation prior to hitting its `<return-to-caller-or-resumer>`
will be thrown back to the caller of the coroutine after destroying the coroutine frame
and the return object.

Be aware of this if your `return-object` has RAII semantics that destroy the coroutine
frame on destruction. If this is the case then you want to make sure that
`co_await promise.initial_suspend()` is `noexcept` to avoid double-free of the
coroutine frame.

> Note that there is a proposal to tweak the semantics so that either all or part of
> the `co_await promise.initial_suspend()` expression lies inside try/catch block of

For many types of coroutine, the `initial_suspend()` method either returns
`std::experimental::suspend_always` (if the operation is lazily started) or
`std::experimental::suspend_never` (if the operation is eagerly started)
which are both `noexcept` awaitables so this is usually not an issue.

### Returning to the caller

When the coroutine function reaches its first `<return-to-caller-or-resumer>` point
(or if no such point is reached then when execution of the coroutine runs to completion)
then the `return-object` returned from the `get_return_object()` call is returned to
the caller of the coroutine.

Note that the type of the `return-object` doesn't need to be the same type as the
return-type of the coroutine function. An implicit conversion from the `return-object`
to the return-type of the coroutine is performed if necessary.

### Returning from the coroutine using `co_return`

When the coroutine reaches a `co_return` statement, it is translated into
either a call to `promise.return_void()` or `promise.return_value(<expr>)`
followed by a `goto FinalSuspend;`.

The rules for the translation are as follows:
* `co_return;`  
   -> `promise.return_void();`
* `co_return <expr>;`  
   -> `<expr>; promise.return_void();` if `<expr>` has type `void`  
   -> `promise.return_value(<expr>);` if `<expr>` does not have type `void`

The subsequent `goto FinalSuspend;` causes all local variables with automatic storage
duration to be destructed in reverse order of construction before then evaluating
`co_await promise.final_suspend();`.

Note that if execution runs off the end of a coroutine without a `co_return` statement
then this is equivalent to having a `co_return;` at the end of the function body.
In this case, if the `promise_type` does not have a `return_void()` method then the
behaviour is undefined.

If either the evaluation of `<expr>` or the call to `promise.return_void()` or `promise.return_value()`
throws an exception then the exception still propagates to `promise.unhandled_exception()` (see below).

### Handling exceptions that propagate out of the coroutine body

If an exception propagates out of the coroutine body then the exception is caught
and the `promise.unhandled_exception()` method is called inside the `catch` block.

Implementations of this method typically call `std::current_exception()` to capture
a copy of the exception to store it away to be later rethrown in a different context.

Alternatively, the implementation could immediately rethrow the exception by executing
a `throw;` statement. For example see [folly::Optional](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/4af3040b4c2192818a413bad35f7a6cc5846ed0b/folly/Optional.h#L587)
However, doing so will (likely - see below) cause the the coroutine frame to be immediately
destroyed and for the exception to propagate out to the caller/resumer. This could cause
problems for some abstractions that assume/require the call to `coroutine_handle::resume()`
to be `noexcept`, so you should generally only use this approach when you have full control
over who/what calls `resume()`.

Note that the current [Coroutines TS](http://wg21.link/N4736)
wording is a [little unclear](https://github.com/GorNishanov/CoroutineWording/issues/17)
on the intended behaviour if the call to `unhandled_exception()` rethrows the exception
(or for that matter if any of the logic outside of the try-block throws an exception).

My current interpretation of the wording is that if control exits the coroutine-body,
either via exception propagating out of `co_await promise.initial_suspend()`,
`promise.unhandled_exception()` or `co_await promise.final_suspend()` or by the
coroutine running to completion by `co_await p.final_suspend()` completing synchronously
then the coroutine frame is automatically destroyed before execution returns to the
caller/resumer. However, this interpretation has its own issues.

A future version of the Coroutines specification will hopefully clarify the situation.
However, until then I'd stay away from throwing exceptions out of `initial_suspend()`,
`final_suspend()` or `unhandled_exception()`. Stay tuned!

### The final-suspend point

Once execution exits the user-defined part of the coroutine body and the result has
been captured via a call to `return_void()`, `return_value()` or `unhandled_exception()`
and any local variables have been destructed, the coroutine has an opportunity
to execute some additional logic before execution is returned back to the caller/resumer.

The coroutine executes the `co_await promise.final_suspend();` statement.

This allows the coroutine to execute some logic, such as publishing a result, signalling
completion or resuming a continuation. It also allows the coroutine to optionally suspend
immediately before execution of the coroutine runs to completion and the coroutine frame
is destroyed.

Note that it is undefined behaviour to `resume()` a coroutine that is suspended at the
`final_suspend` point. The only thing you can do with a coroutine suspended here is
`destroy()` it.

The rationale for this limitation, according to Gor Nishanov, is that this provides
several optimisation opportunities for the compiler due to the reduction in the number
of suspend states that need to be represented by the coroutine and a potential reduction
in the number of branches required.

Note that while it is allowed to have a coroutine not suspend at the `final_suspend` point,
**it is recommended that you structure your coroutines so that they do suspend at `final_suspend`**
where possible.
This is because this forces you to call `.destroy()` on the coroutine from outside
of the coroutine (typically from some RAII object destructor) and this makes it much
easier for the compiler to determine when the scope of the lifetime of the coroutine-frame
is nested inside the caller. This in turn makes it much more likely that the compiler can
elide the memory allocation of the coroutine frame.

### How the compiler chooses the promise type

So lets look now at how the compiler determines what type of promise object to use
for a given coroutine.

The type of the promise object is determined from the signature of the coroutine
by using the `std::experimental::coroutine_traits` class.

If you have a coroutine function with signature:
```c++
task<float> foo(std::string x, bool flag);
```

Then the compiler will deduce the type of the coroutine's promise by passing the
return-type and parameter types as template arguments to `coroutine_traits`.
```c++
typename coroutine_traits<task<float>, std::string, bool>::promise_type;
```

If the function is a non-static member function then the class type is passed
as the second template parameter to `coroutine_traits`. Note that if your method
is overloaded for rvalue-references then the second template parameter will be
an rvalue reference.

For example, if you have the following methods:
```c++
task<void> my_class::method1(int x) const;
task<foo> my_class::method2() &&;
```

Then the compiler will use the following promise types:
```c++
// method1 promise type
typename coroutine_traits<task<void>, const my_class&, int>::promise_type;

// method2 promise type
typename coroutine_traits<task<foo>, my_class&&>::promise_type;
```

The default definition of `coroutine_traits` template defines the `promise_type`
by looking for a nested `promise_type` typedef defined on the return-type.
ie. Something like this (but with some extra SFINAE magic so that `promise_type`
is not defined if `RET::promise_type` is not defined).
```c++
namespace std::experimental
{
  template<typename RET, typename... ARGS>
  struct coroutine_traits<RET, ARGS...>
  {
    using promise_type = typename RET::promise_type;
  };
}
```

So for coroutine return-types that you have control over, you can just define a
nested `promise_type` in your class to have the compiler use that type as the
type of the promise object for coroutines that return your class.

For example:
```c++
template<typename T>
struct task
{
  using promise_type = task_promise<T>;
  ...
};
```

However, for coroutine return-types that you don't have control over you can
specialise the `coroutine_traits` to define the promise type to use without
needing to modify the type.

For example, to define the promise-type to use for a coroutine that returns `std::optional<T>`:
```c++
namespace std::experimental
{
  template<typename T, typename... ARGS>
  struct coroutine_traits<std::optional<T>, ARGS...>
  {
    using promise_type = optional_promise<T>;
  };
}
```

### Identifying a specific coroutine activation frame

When you call a coroutine function, a coroutine frame is created. In order
to resume the associated coroutine or destroy the coroutine frame you need
some way to identify or refer to that particular coroutine frame.

The mechanism the Coroutines TS provides for this is the `coroutine_handle` type.

The (abbreviated) interface of this type is as follows:
```c++
namespace std::experimental
{
  template<typename Promise = void>
  struct coroutine_handle;

  // Type-erased coroutine handle. Can refer to any kind of coroutine.
  // Doesn't allow access to the promise object.
  template<>
  struct coroutine_handle<void>
  {
    // Constructs to the null handle.
    constexpr coroutine_handle();

    // Convert to/from a void* for passing into C-style interop functions.
    constexpr void* address() const noexcept;
    static constexpr coroutine_handle from_address(void* addr);

    // Query if the handle is non-null.
    constexpr explicit operator bool() const noexcept;

    // Query if the coroutine is suspended at the final_suspend point.
    // Undefined behaviour if coroutine is not currently suspended.
    bool done() const;

    // Resume/Destroy the suspended coroutine
    void resume();
    void destroy();
  };

  // Coroutine handle for coroutines with a known promise type.
  // Template argument must exactly match coroutine's promise type.
  template<typename Promise>
  struct coroutine_handle : coroutine_handle<>
  {
    using coroutine_handle<>::coroutine_handle;

    static constexpr coroutine_handle from_address(void* addr);

    // Access to the coroutine's promise object.
    Promise& promise() const;

    // You can reconstruct the coroutine handle from the promise object.
    static coroutine_handle from_promise(Promise& promise);
  };
}
```

You can obtain a `coroutine_handle` for a coroutine in two ways:
1. It is passed to the `await_suspend()` method during a `co_await` expression.
2. If you have a reference to the coroutine's promise object, you can reconstruct
   its `coroutine_handle` using `coroutine_handle<Promise>::from_promise()`.

The `coroutine_handle` of the awaiting coroutine will be passed into the
`await_suspend()` method of the awaiter after the coroutine has suspended
at the `<suspend-point>` of a `co_await` expression. You can think of this
`coroutine_handle` as representing the continuation of the coroutine in a
[continuation-passing style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)
call.

Note that the `coroutine_handle` is **NOT** and RAII object. You must manually
call `.destroy()` to destroy the coroutine frame and free its resources. Think
of it as the equivalent of a `void*` used to manage memory.
This is for performance reasons: making it an RAII object would add additional
overhead to coroutine, such as the need for reference counting.

You should generally try to use higher-level types that provide the RAII semantics
for coroutines, such as those provided by [cppcoro](https://github.com/lewissbaker/cppcoro)
(shameless plug), or write your own higher-level types that encapsulate the lifetime
of the coroutine frame for your coroutine type.

### Customising the behaviour of `co_await`

The promise type can optionally customise the behaviour of every `co_await` expression
that appears in the body of the coroutine.

By simply defining a method named `await_transform()` on the promise type, the compiler
will then transform every `co_await <expr>` appearing in the body of the coroutine into
`co_await promise.await_transform(<expr>)`.

This has a number of important and powerful uses:

**It lets you enable awaiting types that would not normally be awaitable.**

For example, a promise type for coroutines with a `std::optional<T>` return-type
might provide an `await_transform()` overload that takes a `std::optional<U>` and
that returns an awaitable type that either returns a value of type `U` or
suspends the coroutine if the awaited value contains `nullopt`.

```c++
template<typename T>
class optional_promise
{
  ...

  template<typename U>
  auto await_transform(std::optional<U>& value)
  {
    class awaiter
    {
      std::optional<U>& value;
    public:
      explicit awaiter(std::optional<U>& x) noexcept : value(x) {}
      bool await_ready() noexcept { return value.has_value(); }
      void await_suspend(std::experimental::coroutine_handle<>) noexcept {}
      U& await_resume() noexcept { return *value; }
    };
    return awaiter{ value };
  }
};
```

**It lets you disallow awaiting on certain types by declaring `await_transform` overloads as deleted.**

For example, a promise type for `std::generator<T>` return-type might declare
a deleted `await_transform()` template member function that accepts any type.
This basically disables use of `co_await` within the coroutine.

```c++
template<typename T>
class generator_promise
{
  ...

  // Disable any use of co_await within this type of coroutine.
  template<typename U>
  std::experimental::suspend_never await_transform(U&&) = delete;

};
```

**It lets you adapt and change the behaviour of normally awaitable values**

For example, you could define a type of coroutine that ensured that the coroutine
always resumed from every `co_await` expression on an associated executor by wrapping
the awaitable in a `resume_on()` operator (see `cppcoro::resume_on()`).

```c++
template<typename T, typename Executor>
class executor_task_promise
{
  Executor executor;

public:

  template<typename Awaitable>
  auto await_transform(Awaitable&& awaitable)
  {
    using cppcoro::resume_on;
    return resume_on(this->executor, std::forward<Awaitable>(awaitable));
  }
};
```

As a final word on `await_transform()`, it's important to note that if the promise type
defines *any* `await_transform()` members then this triggers the compiler to transform
*all* `co_await` expressions to call `promise.await_transform()`. This means that if you
want to customise the behaviour of `co_await` for just some types that you also need to
provide a fallback overload of `await_transform()` that just forwards through the argument.

### Customising the behaviour of `co_yield`

The final thing you can customise through the promise type is the behaviour of the `co_yield` keyword.

If the `co_yield` keyword appears in a coroutine then the compiler translates the expression `co_yield <expr>`
into the expression `co_await promise.yield_value(<expr>)`. The promise type can therefore customise the
behaviour of the `co_yield` keyword by defining one or more `yield_value()` methods on the promise object.

Note that, unlike `await_transform`, there is no default behaviour of `co_yield` if the promise type
does not define the `yield_value()` method. So while a promise type needs to explicitly opt-out of
allowing `co_await` by declaring a deleted `await_transform()`, a promise type needs to opt-in to
supporting `co_yield`.

The typical example of a promise type with a `yield_value()` method is that of a `generator<T>` type:
```c++
template<typename T>
class generator_promise
{
  T* valuePtr;
public:
  ...

  std::experimental::suspend_always yield_value(T& value) noexcept
  {
    // Stash the address of the yielded value and then return an awaitable
    // that will cause the coroutine to suspend at the co_yield expression.
    // Execution will then return from the call to coroutine_handle<>::resume()
    // inside either generator<T>::begin() or generator<T>::iterator::operator++().
    valuePtr = std::addressof(value);
    return {};
  }
};
```

# Summary

In this post I've covered the individual transformations that the compiler applies
to a function when compiling it as a coroutine.

Hopefully this post will help you to understand how you can customise the behaviour
of different types of coroutines through defining different your own promise type.
There are a lot of moving parts in the coroutine mechanics and so there are lots of
different ways that you can customise their behaviour.

However, there is still one more important transformation that the compiler performs which
I have not yet covered - the transformation of the coroutine body into a state-machine.
However, this post is already too long so I will defer explaining this to the next post.
Stay tuned!
